AUTONOMOUS SPACEPUNK DEVELOPMENT - OVERNIGHT SESSION

WORKFLOW:
1. Run 'gh issue list' to see all open issues
2. Pick the next logical issue to work on (start with simpler ones, build up to complex)
3. Create a new branch: 'git checkout -b issue-<number>-<short-description>'
4. Work on the issue following CLAUDE.md requirements
5. Test thoroughly using 'node test-client.js full'
6. Commit changes with proper message
7. Create PR: 'gh pr create --title "Fix #<number>: <description>" --body "Closes #<number>"'
8. Move to next issue

PRIORITIES:
- Start with database/infrastructure issues (#53, #52, #49, #36, etc)
- Build up to gameplay systems (#54, #55, #56, etc)
- Focus on crew management and trait systems
- Maintain brutalist UI aesthetic
- Test everything before moving on

IF NO MORE ISSUES:
- Research and propose new game mechanics that fit the cyberpunk theme
- Enhance existing systems based on CLAUDE.md vision
- Run playtests and document findings
- Create new issues for discovered improvements

CONSTRAINTS:
- Follow existing code patterns and brutalist design
- Test all changes before committing
- Write clear commit messages and PR descriptions
- Keep the "terrible corporate software" aesthetic
- Maintain the tick-based authoritative server architecture

Work steadily through the night. Make real progress on multiple issues. Be autonomous but thoughtful.
